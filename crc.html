        <font size="7"><b>Preface</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Coffee roasting has always been something of a dark art. Although people have been
        roasting coffee for hundreds of years, little prescriptive or scientific writing about roasting exists. At best,
        roasters learn their trade by apprenticing under an experienced, competent roaster. More commonly, young
        roasters learn by trial and error, roasting and tasting countless batches, and develop a system based on
        folklore and spurious reasoning.<br></br></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">I spent the first ten years of my roasting career lost in the labyrinth of trial and
        error, and while I made some progress, it was usually of the “two steps forward, one step back’� type. I
        desperately wanted a rational basis for my roasting beliefs, one that would prove itself in blind taste tests
        and apply to all beans and roasting machines.<br></br></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">After owning two roasting companies, I have had the good fortune to work as a consultant
        for many roasters. Through consulting I have had the opportunity to use many coffee-roasting machines and
        witness a variety of approaches to roasting and tasting. As part of my consulting work, I have often spent long
        hours analyzing roast data, trying to help my clients quantify their best practices. About six years ago I began
        to notice that the data of the rare, extraordinary batches all shared certain patterns, regardless of the bean
        or machine. I’ve spent the past six years testing and refining those patterns; they form the foundation of the
        system I present in this book.<br></br></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">I don’t claim to have all, or even most, of the answers. Despite my ignorance, I offer
        the ideas in this book to begin a long-overdue conversation about how to systematically roast coffee. Merely
        claiming that coffee roasting should be subjected to a systematic, objective, evidence-based approach is sure to
        offend some coffee professionals. Many roasters believe their special “feel” for roasting makes their coffee
        great. However, as recent technological advances have improved our ability to measure roast development and
        consistency, those “intuitive” roasters’ results have usually been found lacking.<br></br></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">With the introduction of data-logging software and the coffee refractometer, roasters
        have powerful new tools to track and measure results, making the process more predictable and consistent. I
        confess I miss the romance of making countless manual adjustments during a roast, furiously scribbling notes in
        a logbook, and running back and forth between the machine and logbook fifty times per batch. Watching a roast
        profile”�s progress on a computer screen lacks the Visceral satisfaction of the old methods. I don’t roast for
        my own entertainment, however; I roast to give my customers the best-tasting coffee I can. On the rare occasion
        when I allow myself to sit quietly and enjoy a coffee, I’m grateful for the results.<br></br></p><br></br>

        <font size="7"><b>Introduction</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">This book is meant to be a reference for any roaster, whether a beginner or a
        professional. For our purposes, I will focus on <i>light</i>-to-<i>medium</i> roasting of <i>specialty coffee
        </i>processed in a batch <i>drum roaster</i> in 8-16 minutes. Most of what I will discuss also applies to
        <i>continuous roasters</i>, <i>high-yield roasters</i>, <i>fluid-bed roasters</i>, and other roasting
        technologies. However, I will not often refer to such roasting machines directly.<br></br></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">I implore the reader to study this entire book and not focus solely on the “how to”
        chapters. Experience with my previous books has taught me that readers who cherry-pick the parts that appeal to
        them end up missing some of the big picture, leading them to misapply some recommendations. I’ve italicized
        potentially unfamiliar terms throughout the text and defined them in the glossary at the end of the book.</p>

        <font size="7"><b>1: Why We Roast Coffee Beans</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Coffee beans are the seeds of the cherries of the coffee tree. Each cherry typically
        contains two beans whose flat sides face each other. When steeped in hot water, raw, or “green,” coffee beans
        offer little in the way of what one might relate to as coffee <i>taste</i> and <i>aroma</i>.<br></br></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Roasting green coffee creates myriad chemical changes, the production and breakdown of
        thousands of compounds, and, the roaster hopes, the development of beautiful <i>flavors</i> when the beans are
        ground and steeped in hot water. Among its many effects, roasting causes beans to</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">The goal of roasting is to optimize the flavors of coffee’s <i>soluble chemistry</i>.
        Dissolved solids make up brewed coffee’s taste, while dissolved <i>volatile aromatic compounds</i> and oils are
        responsible for aroma.<sup><small><a filepos=0000200208>

        <font size="7"><b>2: Green-Coffee Chemistry</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Raw coffee beans are dense, green seeds consisting of about one-half carbohydrate in
        various forms and one-half a mixture of water, proteins, lipids, acids, and alkaloids. Roasters do not need to
        know much about green coffee’s chemistry to roast delicious coffee, but I offer the following summary to
        familiarize readers with the primary components of green coffee.</p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Structure</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">A raw coffee bean’s structure is a three-dimensional cellulose, or polysaccharide,
        matrix containing approximately a million cells.<sup><small><a filepos=0000198621>
                    <font size="2">10</font>
                </a></small></sup> Coating the cellulose strands within that matrix are hundreds of chemicals that the
        roasting process will transform into the oils and soluble material that determine brewed coffee’s flavor. Green
        coffee’s cellulose structure contributes half of its dry weight.<sup><small><a filepos=0000197899>
                    <font size="2">5</font>
                </a></small></sup> The cellulose contributes little to coffee flavor but does trap some volatile
        compounds, which are responsible for aroma, and adds to brewed coffee’s viscosity, increasing its perceived
        body.<sup><small><a filepos=0000197899>
                    <font size="2">5</font>
                </a></small></sup></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Sugars</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Sugars, dominated by sucrose, make up 6%-9% of a green bean’s dry weight<a
            filepos=0000016582>*</a> and provide sweetness in the cup. Sucrose also contributes to development of
        acidity, as the <i>caramelization</i> of sucrose during roasting yields acetic acid.<sup><small><a
                    filepos=0000197344>
                    <font size="2">2</font>
                </a></small></sup></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Lipids</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Lipids, primarily triglycerides, make up approximately 16% of green coffee’s dry
        weight.<sup><small><a filepos=0000197899>
                    <font size="2">5</font>
                </a></small></sup> Although lipids are not water soluble, brewed coffee contains some, especially when
        the brewing method uses either no filtration (e.g., <i>cupping</i>) or a very porous filter (e.g., espresso,
        French press, or metal- or cloth-filter drip). Lipids in brewed coffee help retain aroma and contribute to
        coffee’s <i>mouthfeel</i>. Higher lipid content is generally associated with better green-coffee
        quality.<sup><small><a filepos=0000197502>
                    <font size="2">3</font>
                </a></small></sup><br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Unfortunately, lipids also present challenges to quality, as they are vulnerable to
        oxidation and rancidity during storage of roasted beans.<br></br></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Proteins</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Proteins and free amino acids make up 10%-13% of green coffee by dry
        weight.<sup><small><a filepos=0000197502>
                    <font size="2">3</font>
                </a></small></sup> Amino acids and <i>reducing sugars</i> in coffee beans interact during roasting in
        nonenzymatic browning reactions known as <i>Maillard reactions</i>. These reactions produce glycosylamines and
        melanoidins<sup><small><a filepos=0000199964>
                    <font size="2">18</font>
                </a></small></sup> that contribute to coffee’s bittersweet flavor, brown color, and roasted, meaty, and
        baked aromas.<br></br></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Alkaloids: Caffeine and Trigonelline</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Two alkaloids, <i>caffeine</i> and <i>trigonelline</i>, each account for approximately
        1% of green coffee’s dry weight and are responsible for much of coffee’s <i>bitterness</i> and stimulating
        properties. Caffeine contributes approximately 10% of coffee’s bitterness and the majority of its stimulant
        effect. The coffee plant produces caffeine as a defense against consumption by insects.<sup><small><a
                    filepos=0000198237>
                    <font size="2">7</font>
                </a></small></sup> A coffee tree planted at a high altitude would probably produce beans with less
        caffeine because of the lower risk of insect attack.<br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Trigonelline is perhaps the greatest contributor to coffee’s bitterness, yields many
        aromatic compounds, and degrades to pyridines and nicotinic acid during roasting.<sup><small><a
                    filepos=0000197502>
                    <font size="2">3</font>
                </a></small></sup> Nicotinic acid is also known as niacin, or vitamin B3; a mere 7 oz (200 g) of brewed
        coffee, depending on roast degree, contains 20-80 ml of niacin,<sup><small><a filepos=0000201353>
                    <font size="2">26</font>
                </a></small></sup> which is likely responsible for coffee’s documented anti-cavity effect.<sup><small><a
                    filepos=0000201048>
                    <font size="2">25</font>
                </a></small></sup></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Moisture Content</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Ideally, water should account for 10.5%-11.5% of green-coffee weight. If moisture
        content is too low, bean color is typically faded and the cup has notes of hay and straw. A roaster must apply
        heat cautiously to low-moisture beans, as they are likely to roast too fast. If moisture content is much higher
        than 12%, green coffee is prone to developing mold and may taste grassy in the cup. Water slows heat transfer
        within beans,<sup><small><a filepos=0000198386>
                    <font size="2">8</font>
                </a></small></sup> and it requires extra heat input to evaporate. Roasting very moist beans therefore
        requires extra energy in some combination of added time and roasting power.<br></br></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Organic Acids</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt"><i>Organic acids</i>, primarily <i>chlorogenic acids</i> (CGAs), constitute
        approximately 7%-10% of green coffee’s dry mass. CGAs contribute to coffee’s acidity, sourness,
        <i>astringency</i>, and bitterness. Robusta coffee’s higher CGA content is likely responsible for its
        significantly greater bitterness. For both the coffee bean and the coffee drinker, CGAs offer antioxidant
        benefits.<sup><small><a filepos=0000203661>
                    <font size="2">38</font>
                </a></small></sup> Other organic acids in coffee include citric, quinic, caffeic, malic, acetic, and
        formic.<br></br></p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Gases and Aromatics</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Volatile aromatic compounds provide coffee’s aroma. Green coffee contains more than 200
        volatiles but offers little aroma. Roasting creates the vast majority of coffee’s aromatic compounds, and so
        far, researchers have identified over 800 volatiles in roasted coffee.<sup><small><a filepos=0000198386>

    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt"><i>This chapter was cowritten by Ryan Brown.</i></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Green-coffee processing affects cup quality as well as how one should roast beans. Once
        a bean has been processed, a roaster must carefully control its packaging and storage conditions to prevent
        degradation of quality before it’s roasted.</p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Primary Processing Methods</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Washed, natural, and pulped natural are the three primary processing methods of
        specialty coffee.</p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="4"><b>Wet/Washed</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">The Washed, or wet, process consists of the following steps:<br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">1. Pulping of the cherry to remove the skin.</p>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">2. Removal of the sticky mucilage layer by fermentation or mechanical means.</p>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">3. Washing of the beans to remove loosened mucilage.</p>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">4. Drying of the beans in parchment, either mechanically for 1-2 days or in the sun for
        3-16 days.</p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="4"><b>Dry/Natural</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">The natural, or dry, process consists of partially or completely drying the coffee
        cherries on the tree and then husking the cherries to remove their skins. Alternatively, the cherries are picked
        when ripe and then dried before husking.</p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="4"><b>Pulped/Natural</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">In the pulped/natural process, the cherries are pulped to remove their skin and set to
        dry with the mucilage layer intact. This method delivers a sweeter, cleaner cup than does the traditional
        natural process.<br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Washed processing produces cleaner, more acidic, more consistent, and generally
        more-prized coffee than natural processing does. Washed coffees also tend to be denser and require more
        aggressive roasting. The dry process can take several weeks and yields coffee with less acidity, more body, and
        earthier flavors than washed coffee. Arid growing areas often use the natural process because it requires much
        less water than the washed process. Natural-processed coffees burn more easily during roasting, so one should
        use lower <i>charge temperatures</i> and gas settings when roasting those beans.</p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Green Coffee Storage</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Until recent years, all coffee was packaged in <i>burlap</i> (jute) sacks and shipped in
        containers, arriving at roasters months after the coffee was processed. Roasters and importers frequently had
        the experience of cupping a coffee at origin, and perhaps cupping and approving a “pre-shipment sample,” only to
        receive coffee ruined by exposure to poor atmospheric conditions in storage or in transit.<br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">In the past ten years, several small, quality-driven roasters have spearheaded a
        revolution in green-coffee packaging and transport. Many roasting companies, even some of the smallest ones, now
        buy coffee directly from farmers, share cupping and green-grading information with the farmers, and demand
        speedy delivery of coffee in packaging designed to preserve its freshness and quality. Such packaging is costly
        but justified, given the ever-increasing premiums paid for specialty coffees.</p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">The following is a survey of the more prominent packaging options:</p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt"><i>Burlap (jute) bags</i> are the most common and economical option for packaging and
        transporting green coffee. Jute is a renewable resource, and the bags are cheap; their use requires no special
        skills or equipment beyond those that are standard at any dry mill or exporting operation. Burlap sacks do not
        protect coffee from moisture or odors, however, so the coffee is vulnerable to damage during transport and
        storage.</p><br></br>

            photo) and GrainPro bags (right photo) protect beans from moisture and odors.</i></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt"><i>Vacuum sealing</i> is the best available packaging for green coffee. Vacuum-sealed
        bags protect beans from moisture, odors, and oxygen, dramatically slowing the respiration, and therefore the
        aging, of green coffee. Before vacuum sealing, care must be taken to measure beans’ water activity to prevent
        development of mold during storage. Vacuum packaging costs approximately USD 0.15-0.25 per pound (EUR 0.45-0.75
        per kilogram), requires special equipment and skill to implement, and often delays shipment of green coffee, so
        it is not without its costs and risks.</p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt"><i>GrainPro</i> and other <i>hermetically sealed</i> bags protect coffee against
        moisture and odors and are cheaper and easier to use than vacuum packaging. GrainPro bags preserve coffee
        significantly longer than burlap sacks but perhaps half as long as vac-sealed bags do. At a cost of about USD
        0.05-0.10 per pound (EUR 0.15-0.30 per kilogram), GrainPro bags are often the best and most practical option for
        quality-conscious roasters. As with vacuum sealing, to prevent development of mold and other microorganisms
        during storage, it is important to measure beans’ water activity before packaging them in GrainPro bags.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt"><i>Freezing</i>—that is, storing green coffee in vacuum-sealed bags at a temperature
        below 32°F (0°C)—preserves flavor almost perfectly for years. Some roasters freeze special lots of beans and
        offer them as “vintage” coffees years after harvest, but there is not much consumer demand for such coffees at
        the moment. While it’s impressive to experience five-year-old beans that taste as good as last month’s crop,
        freezing is expensive and, arguably, wasteful. Freezing is an alternative worth considering in hot climates,
        however, as storage in extreme heat for a few days will ruin most green coffees.</p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Regardless of the packaging type she chooses, a roaster should take steps to ensure that
        her warehouse provides stable storage conditions all year round. Excessively warm or humid conditions; storing
        beans high off the ground, where the temperature may be hotter than realized; and storing beans too close to a
        hot roasting machine can all degrade green-coffee quality.</p>

        <font size="5"><b>Water Activity and Moisture Content</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Water activity (a<sub><small>
                <font size="2">w</font>
            </small></sub>) is a measure of the strength of the bond between water and the dry material of a coffee bean
        or other food product. (Please refer to the glossary, at the end of the book, for a more technical definition.)
        The a<sub><small>
                <font size="2">w</font>
            </small></sub> level indicates how likely moisture is to migrate into or out of a bean, which in turn
        affects how beans interact with their storage environment and how fast they degrade during storage.<br></br></p>
    <br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Water activity differs from moisture content, which is the percentage, by weight, of
        water in green coffee. The two measures correlate, though their correlation may decrease when moisture content
        rises above 12%. Both characteristics influence cup quality, the degradation rate of green coffee during
        storage, and the risk of microbial growth during storage.</p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">I am not aware of formal research into what a<sub><small>
                <font size="2">w</font>
            </small></sub> levels correlate most with cup quality. An informal poll of importers and green buyers I
        admire suggests that the optimum a<sub><small>
                <font size="2">w</font>
            </small></sub> level ranges between 0.53 and 0.59. The ideal range of moisture contents is better
        established: Based on my experience, I recommend that roasters acquire green coffee having a moisture content of
        10.5%-11.5%. Choosing a green coffee with a<sub><small>
                <font size="2">w</font>
            </small></sub> and moisture content in those ranges and storing it in a stable environment of perhaps
        68°F-72°F (20°C-22°C) and 45%-50% relative humidity should offer optimal conditions for stabilizing quality.
        Beans in hermetically sealed bags may benefit from colder storage temperatures but should be warmed to room
        temperature for several days before roasting.</p><br></br>

        <font size="5"><b>Seasonality</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">In recent years, roasters have emphasized offering only coffees that are “in season.”
        Like much else in the coffee industry, there is no consensus definition of seasonality. Some consider a coffee
        to be seasonal if it is from the most recent harvest, While others define seasonality based on an arbitrary
        amount of time elapsed since harvest.</p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">I offer a definition of seasonality in the words of my friend Ryan Brown, an expert
        green buyer: “We care about seasonality because we care about cup quality. A coffee should be considered
        seasonal so long as the cup is vibrant, shows structured acidity, and is free of any signs of ‘age’ (such as
        paperiness, ‘bagginess,’ dryness, loss of organic material, etc.). It doesn’t need to be any more complicated
        than that.”</p>

    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Roasting causes beans to change color, lose moisture, expand, and become brittle. While
        all professionals label roast levels based on bean color, there is no consensus on exactly what roast level each
        name indicates.</p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Color Changes</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">The first stage of roasting is commonly known as the “drying phase,’� although beans
        lose moisture at similar rates throughout most of the roasting process. During the first few minutes of
        roasting, degradation of chlorophyll causes beans to change color from green to yellow. As roasting progresses,
        the beans change from yellow to tan to light brown, primarily due to Maillard reactions. Late in a roast, as the
        beans approach <i>first crack</i>, the brown color deepens due to caramelization. In a dark roast,
        <i>carbonization</i> may turn beans black.</p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">

    <p height="0pt" width="0pt"><i>During roasting, coffee beans change from green to yellow to tan to brown, and, if
            roasted very dark, black. No universal system exists for naming different degrees of roast; what one roaster
            calls a "light roast" another roaster may label "full city.”</i><br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Light roasts offer acidic, floral, and fruity flavors, more delicate aroma, and less
        body than <i>dark roasts</i>. Dark roasts develop smoky, <i>pungent</i>, bitter, and carbonized flavors. If one
        takes roasting to an extreme, burnt flavors dominate and body declines. </p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">The coffee industry’s lack of an agreed-upon nomenclature for degrees of roast causes
        confusion among roasters and consumers alike. I don’t claim to offer the “correct” definitions for different
        roast levels, but I believe the following descriptors represent common and reasonable interpretations of various

        oiliest, and most bitter and carbonized roast level has come to be known as <i>Italian roast</i>. Almost all
        Italian roasts are rancid by the time they are consumed because their degraded cellulose structures allow rapid

        <font size="5"><b>Structural Changes</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">The microstructure of green coffee is relatively organized and dense, with oils coating
        the cellulose matrix.<sup><small><a filepos=0000198621>
                    <font size="2">10</font>
                </a></small></sup> As coffee roasts, the generation of steam and carbon dioxide (CO<sub><small>
                <font size="2">2</font>
            </small></sub>) increases pressure within the beans, forcing their structure to expand and pores to enlarge.
        A couple of minutes before first crack, beans expand enough to begin freeing the silver-colored skin, or
        <i>chaff</i>, trapped within the folds of their center cracks. When the cellulose can stretch no farther,
        fissures form within beans and on their surfaces, violently expelling water vapor and gases, creating the
        popping noises of first crack.<br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Specialty roasters seeking a light or medium roast typically drop beans between the end
        of first crack and the beginning of second crack. After first crack, gas production continues, rebuilding
        pressure within the bean cells. Simultaneously, the bean structure becomes more brittle, setting the stage for
        second crack. While the primary cause of first crack is the buildup of steam pressure, accumulation of
        CO<sub><small>
                <font size="2">2</font>
            </small></sub> is the main driver of second crack. Just before or after the onset of second crack, oils
        bleed to the bean surfaces; almost all roasters would regard this as an objective indicator of a dark roast.</p>

        <font size="5"><b>Inner-Bean Development</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Bean expansion and the release of water vapor and gases during the cracking phases
        weaken beans’ cellulose structures and make them more porous and brittle. The darker, more porous, and more
        brittle the inner beans are, the more developed they are. Sufficient inner-bean development is a prerequisite
        for great grind quality, high extraction, and elimination of undesirable savory flavors.<br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Inner-bean development lags behind outer-bean development during roasting. A roaster
        must skillfully manage the process to ensure that the inner bean is sufficiently roasted by the time the outer
        bean reaches its intended color. Ideally, the final “spread,” or color difference, between the inner and outer
        bean should be negligible in a light roast. The darker the roast, the larger the acceptable spread, provided the
        inner bean has developed to a certain minimum degree. Throughout this book, I will discuss strategies to
        optimize inner-bean development.</p>

        <font size="5"><b>Bean Size, Density, and Weight Loss</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Coffee loses 12%-24% of its weight during roasting, depending on initial moisture
        content, roast degree, and inner-bean development during roasting. The lightest palatable roasts are probably
        those dropped during the latter stages of first crack and typically have weight loss, or <i>shrinkage</i>, of
        11%-13%.<a filepos=0000039501>****</a> About 30 seconds after first crack ends, shrinkage is roughly 14%-16%,
        while at the onset of second crack, shrinkage is around 17%-18%. Dark, oily roasts may have shrinkage of 22% or
        more. The light roasts currently popular in the specialty industry lose an average of 14%-16% of their initial
        weight.<br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">In a light roast, water accounts for up to 90% of the lost weight. The rest is organic
        matter, primarily CO<sub><small>
                <font size="2">2</font>
            </small></sub>, as well as small amounts of chaff, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, volatile aromatic compounds,
        and volatile acids. Organic losses increase significantly with darker roasting: Organic-matter loss is 5%-8% in
        medium roasts and as high as 12% in very dark roasts.<sup><small><a filepos=0000197899>
                    <font size="2">5</font>
                </a></small></sup> As beans lose weight during roasting, they also expand to 150%-190% of their original
        volume. The simultaneous loss of weight and gain in volume equates to a density loss of almost half.</p>

    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">** Coffee importer Timothy Castle coined the term “third wave” in 2000 in reference to a
        movement refocusing on coffee quality. Castle described the first wave as the emergence of pioneering,
        quality-obsessed coffee entrepreneurs in the 1960s, ’70s, and ’80s who offered the first modern alternatives to
        large, institutional roasters. The second-wavers were a group of skilled businesspeople in the ’80s and ’90s who
        offered quality coffee but were more business savvy and profit oriented than the first-wavers. The third wave
        developed as a rebellion against the compromises of the second wave and offers a renewed commitment to coffee
        quality. Common usage of “third wave” has evolved away from Castle’s original definition and now typically
        refers to companies favoring lighter roasts and brewed-to-order coffee made by hipsters.<br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">*** I think of full city and Viennese roasts as the “crowd pleasers,” though most
        connoisseurs and third-wave companies frown upon such roasts. Critics contend that a lighter roast highlights a

        delicacy.<br></br></p><br></br>

        aroma compounds. The roasting process also conveniently makes the beans brittle enough to grind easily and
        porous enough to allow water to access and extract their soluble flavors.</p>

        <font size="5"><b>Changes in Chemical Composition</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">A little more than one-third of roasted coffee, by weight, is water soluble. Proper
        brewing extracts approximately 19%-22% of roasted coffee’s mass (or about 55%-60% of its soluble material, plus
        a tiny amount of lipids and cellulose fragments known as <i>fines</i>).<br></br></p>

    <p height="0pt" width="0pt"><i>From this perspective, the most significant changes in bean composition during
            roasting are the loss of moisture from the bean (moisture drops from 12% to 2% of bean mass) and the

                </small></sub> (from negligible to 2% of bean mass). The relevant amount of most dry components increase
            by 1 percentage point, due to water loss. Their weights don’t change much during roasting, but their measure
            as a proportion of total bean weight increases. Please note: The numbers in the pie charts represent
            estimated norms; actual proportions will vary depending on the type of green coffee used, the roast degree,

        5.8, decreases during roasting, and troughs (i.e., the level of acidity peaks) during first crack, at about 4.8,
        before steadily increasing with further roasting.<sup><small><a filepos=0000199547>

        <font size="5"><b>Aroma Development</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">The development of desirable aroma doesn’t begin in earnest until several minutes into
        the roasting process. Rapid development of volatile aromatic compounds occurs at around the time bean moisture
        drops below 5%.<sup><small><a filepos=0000198386>
                    <font size="2">8</font>
                </a></small></sup> Caramelization and Maillard reactions, as well as degradation of amino acids, sugars,
        phenolic acids, and lipids, contribute to the development of aromatics.<sup><small><a filepos=0000198386>
                    <font size="2">8</font>
                </a></small></sup> Caramelization yields fruity, caramelly, nutty, and other aromas, while Maillard
        reactions produce savory, floral, chocolaty, earthy, and roasted aromas, among others.<br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">The oils in coffee dissolve much of its volatile aromatic compounds and slowly release
        them as aroma during and after brewing.<sup><small><a filepos=0000198386>
                    <font size="2">8</font>
                </a></small></sup> Aroma content peaks at a light to medium roast. With further roasting, aroma
        destruction outpaces its creation, and aromatics become smokier and more pungent. Roasted beans gradually lose
        aroma during storage through outgassing. Darker roasts, with their weaker and more porous cellulose structures,
        lose aromatics more quickly than lighter roasts do.</p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Maillard Reactions and Caramelization</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">As noted, Maillard reactions are nonenzymatic browning reactions between free amino
        acids and reducing sugars, and they contribute to coffee’s brown color, bittersweet flavor, and various aromas.
        Maillard reactions occur in the cooking of many foods, perhaps most familiarly in the browning of
        meats. <br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">To understand the Maillard reactions’ contribution to flavor, consider the different
        effects of roasting and boiling on the flavor of meat: Roasting imparts aromatics, complexity, and depth of
        flavor absent in boiled meats. Maillard reactions contribute similar roast-flavor traits and complexity to
        coffee beans.</p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">During roasting, once a bean’s internal temperature is high enough to boil off most of
        its moisture, the temperature rises more rapidly, speeding Maillard reactions. This is one reason aroma
        development accelerates at mid-roast. Maillard reactions become self-sustaining at above 320°F (160°C).</p>
    <br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Unlike Maillard reactions, caramelization is a form of pyrolysis, or thermal
        decomposition. Caramelization begins at approximately 340°F (171°C),<sup><small><a filepos=0000200093>
                    <font size="2">19</font>
                </a></small></sup> as the heat of roasting breaks apart molecules of sugar and produces hundreds of new
        compounds, including smaller, bitter, sour, and aromatic molecules and larger, brown, flavorless
        molecules.<sup><small><a filepos=0000200093>
                    <font size="2">19</font>
                </a></small></sup> Although most people associate the word “caramel” with a very sweet dessert food,
        caramelization, ironically, decreases the sweetness and increases the bitterness of a food or beverage. Lighter
        roasts are sweeter, and darker roasts more bitter and caramelly, primarily because of caramelization.</p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Caffeine Content and Roasting</b></font><br></br>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Despite what almost everyone has heard, darker roasting does not decrease the caffeine
        content of coffee beans. Caffeine levels are virtually unchanged by roasting,<sup><small><a filepos=0000197502>
                    <font size="2">3</font>
                </a></small></sup> as caffeine is stable at typical roasting temperatures. Given that beans lose mass
        during roasting, their proportion of caffeine by weight increases during roasting. Therefore, assuming one brews
        coffee of all roast degrees with a particular ratio of water to ground-coffee mass, rather than volume, darker
        roasts will yield brewed coffee with higher caffeine content.</p><br></br>
    <hr>
    </hr>
    <p height="6pt" width="0pt">* The breakdown of CGA also occurs in brewed coffee, particularly when the brewed
        coffee’s temperature drops below 175°F (79°C). It is imperative to hold brewed coffee between 175°F-195°F
        (79°C-91°C) to stabilize CGA levels and limit the development of sour and astringent flavors. <br></br></p>

    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">Coffee roasting machines transfer heat to beans by <i>convection</i>, <i>conduction</i>,
        and <i>radiation</i>. Each roasting machine transfers heat by a different mix of these mechanisms. The following
        is an overview of how machine design affects heat transfer. I discuss roasting machine designs extensively in <a
            filepos=0000058832>Chapter 7</a>.</p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">
        <font size="5"><b>Convection, Conduction, and Radiation</b></font>
    </p>
    <p height="1em" width="0pt">“Classic” (my term) drum roasters, which apply heat directly to the drum, cook beans
        primarily by convection and secondarily by conduction. Radiant heating from hot roasting-machine surfaces and
        between neighboring beans makes a small contribution to heat transfer as well. In a personal communication with
        me, a representative of a well-known German manufacturer estimated heat transfer in his company’s drum roasters
        to be 70% by convection and 30% by conduction. <br></br></p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Indirectly heated drum roasters segregate the drum from the heat source to maintain a
        cooler drum during roasting. Convection contributes a higher proportion of the heat transfer in these machines.
    </p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Fluid-bed roasters have no drum, and they roast by keeping the beans aloft in a
        high-velocity stream of hot gases. Recirculation roasters, such as the Loring Smart Roaster™, capture and reuse
        a proportion of the exhaust air from the roasting process. Both of these roasting machine designs transfer heat
        almost exclusively by convection.</p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">At the beginning of a roast batch, charging the beans introduces a large volume of
        room-temperature beans and air into the hot roaster, sending the environmental temperature in the roaster
        plummeting. During the first few minutes of a batch in a classic drum roaster, conduction from the hot drum
        plays a significant role in transferring heat to the beans. As the air temperature in the roaster rebounds after
        its initial plunge, convection comes to dominate heat transfer. In such a machine the drum acts as a
        “heat-storage” device that jump-starts development early in a batch. Convection-oriented machines call for the
        use of hotter charge temperatures to provide adequate heat transfer early in a roast and compensate for lack of
        a heat-storing drum.</p><br></br>
    <p height="0pt" width="0pt" align="center"><i>Establishing a high ∆T early in a roast and minimizing it by the end

                                            abandoned the double drum and substituted a static plate, or "heat shield,”
                                            between the flame and drum. Despite these manufacturers’ claims,
                                            single-layer drums with heat shields are usually interior to double drums.
                                            The problem is that the heat shield gets extraordinarily hot because it is
                                            stationary and in constant contact with the flame (A double drum’s rotation
                                            prevents any one area from overheating due to continual contact with the
                                            flame.) I measured one heat shield at 950°F (510°C) with an infrared
                                            thermometer during a typical roast. The heat shield interferes with the
                                            machine operator's control at a roast by radiating large quantities of heat
                                            even when the flame is off.</i></p>

                                        from direct flame contact, allowing the machine operator to use higher roasting

                                        airflow early in a roast and declining amounts of airflow as a batch

                                    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">Most fluid-bed roasters do not include a separate
                                        cooling bin; instead, room temperature air is passed through the roasting
                                        chamber at the end of a batch to cool the beans. This system is not ideal
                                        because the chamber’s surfaces are hot, which inhibits the cooling process. Many

                                        recirculation roasters send a portion of a roast’s exhaust air back through the
                                        burner chamber to recapture its heat, thereby decreasing the fuel requirements
                                        of the roasting process. These machines have recently become popular by virtue
                                        of being very fuel efficient, limiting bean-surface burning, and providing a
                                        very stable, moist, and repeatable roasting environment. The stable environment
                                        offers the side benefit of improving the ability of automated roasting software
                                        to track a programmed roast profile. The one significant drawback to these
                                        machines is a higher risk of smoky flavors in the coffee due to the beans
                                        dwelling in smokier air during roasting.<br></br></p><br></br>

                                        then rapidly increases. In reality, bean temperature does not drop: The beans
                                        enter the roaster at room temperature and immediately get hotter. The apparent

                                        the use of the misleading terms “drying phase’� and “development time.’�
                                        Roasting is a complex process in which development and moisture loss, among
                                        other changes, occur continuously throughout a batch. The practice of referring
                                        to the first phase of roasting as the “drying phase’� and the last stage as
                                        “development time’� has led to much misunderstanding of the roasting
                                        process.<br></br></p>

                                        turned a shade of tan or light brown, begins the neglected, nameless, middle
                                        phase. During this phase sugars break down to form acids<sup><small><a

                                        emit pleasant, bready aromas. The changes in color and aroma are largely the
                                        work of Maillard reactions, which accelerate as bean temperatures reach
                                        approximately 250°F-300°F (121°C-149°C).<br></br></p><br></br>
                                    <p height="0pt" width="0pt">At approximately 340°F (171°C), caramelization begins,
                                        which degrades sugars, thus slowing the Maillard reactions by stealing their
                                        fuel. Caramelization deepens the beans’ brown color and creates fruity,
                                        caramelly, and nutty aromas. Both Maillard reactions and caramelization decrease
                                        coffee’s sweetness and increase bitterness.</p><br></br>

                                        causes them to shed their chaff, or silver skin. Simultaneously, smoke develops,
                                        and the machine operator must ensure the airflow is high enough to exhaust the
                                        chaff and smoke as it forms. Inadequate airflow at this stage may lead to
                                        smoky-flavored coffee and could create a fire hazard if chaff builds up

                                        The beans spontaneously expand and expel chaff, and smoke development

                                        unique character because caramelization and pyrolysis yield heavy, pungent, and
                                        roasty flavors that overwhelm whatever subtle flavors survive such dark
                                        roasting. In the cup, dark roasts exhibit bittersweet and smoky flavors; heavy,
                                        syrupy body; and minimal acidity. If roasting is taken much further than early
                                        second crack, then burnt, carbonized flavors appear and body declines. While
                                        perhaps the majority of specialty coffee chains roast into second crack, today’s
                                        progressive specialty roasters rarely do.</p><br></br>

                                        term that oversimplifies the roasting process. As shown in the graph “Inner Vs.

                                        several seconds a batch is in the roaster, inner-bean development occurs
                                        continually until the end of the roast. Roasters often attempt to improve
                                        development, especially in roasts for espresso, by lengthening the roast time
                                        after first crack. Extending the roast time after first crack will usually
                                        increase development of the bean core, but the more efficient way to improve
                                        inner-bean development is to create a larger temperature gradient earlier in the
                                        roast. Intentionally extending the last few minutes of a roast usually creates

                                        machine’s optimal range of batch sizes. One must consider a machine’s drum size,
                                        airflow range, and rated burner output to decide what batch sizes will taste
                                        best. One should not assume that a roaster’s stated capacity is its optimal
                                        batch size; I have found that many, if not most, machines produce the best
                                        coffee at 50%-70% of their nominal capacity.<br></br></p><br></br>

                                        machine’s drum. Filling a drum past its stated capacity may lead to less

                                        transferring only a portion of its burner energy to the beans. Much of its heat
                                        is lost up the stack, and some is lost to the roasting room and other areas. My
                                        experience with dozens of different machines indicates that real-world,
                                        single-pass roasting is 50%-75% efficient. In other words, single-pass roasters
                                        consume up to twice as much energy than they transfer to the beans. Therefore,
                                        if your 12 kg machine has a rating of 100,000 BTU (105,506 kJ), your maximum
                                        batch should be approximately 20 lb (9 kg). With some experimentation, you may
                                        find that your preferred batch size is a little larger or smaller, and it will
                                        vary with different beans, but I recommend a batch size of 20 lb (9 kg) as the
                                        starting point for experimentation. Fluid-bed roasters are less efficient than
                                        single-pass drum roasters, and recirculation roasters are more efficient than
                                        single-pass machines, so they can accommodate different batch sizes relative to
                                        their burner ratings. The efficiency of a recirculation roaster increases with
                                        the proportion of heat it recycles.<br></br></p><br></br>

                                        (204°C). However, several practical considerations make roasting very small

                                        acts as a heat-storage device, storing tens of thousands of kilojoules of heat
                                        energy. This stored energy contributes to heat transfer early in a roast and
                                        compensates for some or all of the lower charge temperatures that directly
                                        heated drums demand. Adequate heat transfer during the first minutes of a roast

                                        faster roast calls for establishing a larger AT early in the batch to ensure

                                        coffee’s density, bean size, and moisture content. Knowing those three
                                        measurements allows a roaster to predict how to apply heat to the beans during
                                        roasting. The details of how to translate the measurements into roasting
                                        decisions are beyond the scope of this book, but I recommend tracking these

                                        always refers to the empty roaster’s air temperature just before beans are
                                        loaded into the machine, there is no consensus on what temperature one is
                                        referring to: Some machine operators base charge temperature on the bean probe
                                        reading, others base it on the air probe reading. Those two readings are not
                                        only non-transferable between machines, but two consecutive identical batches
                                        charged in the same machine at a probe reading of, for example, 400°F (204°C)
                                        may behave quite differently. The problem is that charge temperature is an
                                        incomplete, and often inconsistent, representation of a machine’s thermal
                                        energy. For example, in the scenario above, the machine’s drum surface
                                        temperature may have been 500°F (260°C) when charging the first batch but 520°F
                                        (271°C) during the second batch’s charge. That small difference in drum
                                        temperature will result in different roast profiles. All operators have
                                        experienced this phenomenon when trying to make the first batch of a roast day
                                        behave identically to batches roasted later in that session. Most operators just
                                        accept that their first two or three batches each day will roast differently
                                        from later batches, and they try to work around the problem by roasting decaf or
                                        particularly small batches first, each session. In “Between-Batch Protocol” in
                                        Chapter 11, I discuss how to reset a machine’s thermal energy before each batch
                                        to ensure consistent results, even on the first batch of the day.<br></br></p>

                                                        recommend that roasters adjust the last phase of a roast curve
                                                        to ensure it is proportional to the entire roast curve. I hope
                                                        roasters will find this suggested ratio useful and that the
                                                        conversation among roasters shifts from “development time” to
                                                        “development time ratio” or a similar phrase.</p>

                                                        have inquired about the appropriateness of a 20%-25% development

                                                        through first crack.) While the best roasts I’ve ever tasted all
                                                        had DTRs greater than 20%, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend such

                                                        from, respectively, the first and second batches roasted that

                                                        roasted the samples that morning. I had guessed the order

                                                        admitted to having difficulty with the quality of the first few
                                                        batches of a roasting session. The problem is usually caused by
                                                        inadequate warming up of the roasting machine. Most machine
                                                        operators warm up a roaster to the charge temperature and then

                                                        time, usually 15-30 minutes, before charging the first batch.
                                                        This protocol guarantees that the first batch will roast

                                                        are poor indicators of a machine’s thermal energy. (See “Charge

                                                        roasting machine warms up, although the temperature probes
                                                        quickly indicate that the air in the machine has reached
                                                        roasting-level temperatures, the mass of the machine is still
                                                        much cooler than the air in the drum. If one charges a batch at
                                                        this point, the machine’s mass will behave akin to a heat sink
                                                        and absorb heat from the roasting process, decreasing the rate
                                                        of heat transfer to the beans. After several roast batches, the
                                                        machine’s thermal energy will reach an equilibrium range within
                                                        which it will fluctuate for the remainder of the roasting

                                                        recommend storing your entire raw-coffee inventory in a

                                                        You can build such a room cheaply, furnish it with a

                                                        the cupping process. Something as simple as pouring 10 g more

                                                        equilibrate your cupping extraction level with your typical
                                                        brewing extraction. For example, if you prepare your espresso

                                                        However, I recommend cupping at lower brew strength than you
                                                        likely prefer. Brew strengths of approximately 1.15%-1.35% are
                                                        strong enough to give a cupper a fair impression of a coffee’s

                                                        professionals prefer drinking stronger brews, but additional
                                                        brew strength may hamper one’s ability to discern subtleties in
                                                        a coffee. To me, cupping isn’t about maximizing enjoyment as

                                                        mistakes. Roasting also heavily influences a cup’s balance of
                                                        acid, sweetness, caramel, and bittersweet flavors.

                                                        table’s recommendations: Suppose you are cupping a light roast
                                                        of a Kenyan coffee with notes of lemon, blueberry, grass,
                                                        cardboard, and smoke, and you find the coffee a little more
                                                        acidic than you would prefer. I would categorize the lemon and
                                                        blueberry flavors as inherent bean traits, whereas the grass,
                                                        cardboard, and smoke flavors are roast artifacts. The grassiness
                                                        indicates you could have developed the coffee a little more.
                                                        Increasing development will also likely curb the excess acidity.
                                                        The smokiness indicates a need for more airflow, and the

                                                        blends of various beans. Blending allows a roaster to create a

                                                        Alternatively, blending also enables a roaster to offer a more
                                                        consistent flavor profile throughout the year; substitute

                                                        Pressure within the beans causes the gases to desorb (i.e., to

                                                        Roasting hotter or darker produces more gas, greater internal

                                                        larger machines. They have usually replied with vague references
                                                        to smaller machines having “different physics,” whatever that

                                                        nasty emissions, many of which are carcinogenic, including
                                                        volatile organic compounds, aldehydes, nitrogen compounds,
                                                        sulfur compounds, and carbon monoxide. The particulate matter in
                                                        smoke from roasters contributes to air pollution, and the odor
                                                        of the emissions often bothers neighbors. Most jurisdictions do
                                                        not require small roasters to use pollution-control devices, but
                                                        without one, a roaster may run into problems with neighbors who
                                                        file “nuisance complaints” about the roaster’s smoke and smell.
                                                        I had a long, stressful, and expensive conflict with the
                                                        neighbors of my first roastery, even though I was roasting only
                                                        20 lb batches for 10 hours per week in the business district of
                                                        a small town. My advice is to do your homework, find out what
                                                        your local government requires, and try to figure out what your
                                                        neighbors will accept before you install a roaster. A little
                                                        research ahead of time may save you a lot of headaches later.

                                                        afterburner: <i>thermal oxidizer</i> or <i>catalytic
                                                            oxidizer</i>. A thermal oxidizer heats a roaster’s exhaust
                                                        gases to approximately 1400°F (760°C) and retains the air for at
                                                        least 0.4 second. It does a great job of eliminating smoke,
                                                        volatile organic compounds, and odors but consumes a tremendous
                                                        amount of fuel, often twice as much as its associated roasting
                                                        machine. Catalytic oxidizers use a precious-metal catalyst that
                                                        reacts with volatile organic compounds to produce CO<sub><small>

                                                        reactions, allowing them to occur at lower temperatures.
                                                        Catalytic oxidizers use less fuel than thermal oxidizers do, but
                                                        they require periodic replacement of the catalyst and frequent
